##YouTube-Spotify-App
###Description
This app gets the liked songs on users 
YouTube account and makes a Spotify 
playlist out of these songs. The idea is 
to keep Spotify account up-to-date in sense
of music and collect the whole musical 
experience in Spotify.
###Goal
The personal gain from this project is 
getting familiar with REST API's 
(YouTube and Spotify API's) 
and JSON format.
